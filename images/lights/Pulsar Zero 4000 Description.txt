Pulsar Zero 4000 is a four channel sound to light unit, each of if lighting channels can be 
Individual Switches giving an independents to the channels. 
There is a master dimmer control switch that gives a half power dim but if there is only a small loads 
on each channel the light tend to flicker a little but you wouldn’t notice it unless someone pointed 
this out. The Pulsar zero 4000 utilize Individual flash buttons for each lighting channels 
theses are manually control, very easy to give I individual pulse to the channel. 
There is a Chase Speed control that allows chasing from a very slow Speed to very fast strobe Speeds. 
The sound input in on the back via a ¼ inch jack plug connector, and the power out is an 8 pin 
Bulgin socket outlet. Each channel has a Max power 5A 1200 watts, 12A Total. 
The Pulsar Zero 3000 light controller is exactly like the Pulsar Zero 4000 chasing controllers 
the only difference is Pulsar Zero 3000 is 3ch light Chaser not 4ch.
Pulsar Zero 4000 & Pulsar Zero 3000 are now classed as vintage retro lighting controllers but still 
very useable and reliable. For many years the industry standard Zero 3000 and 4000 units have held 
the top slot. Now Pulsar has produced the Pulsar Zero 4001 lighting controller. I am presently using 
two disco lighting Pulsars zero 3000’s as lighting sub zones. Doing this add 4 more channels and a 
much greater versatility to my NJD LOGIC 10 way switch.
